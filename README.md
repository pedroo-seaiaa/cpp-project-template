# cpp-project-template
A C++ Project Template

<!-- TODO(PO): Add CI badges from https://shields.io/ -->

## Description

This is a simple project template, which main language is C++. Its main purpose is to demonstrate clean code and clean architecture.

## Getting Started

This project serves as a template so it will probably be missing the software requirements you need for your particular experiment/project.

However, the sample code provided contains a list of software that is required to either build, test or lint the project. Unlike other README files, I decided to keep this information on a script file that will detect and prompt to install said requirements, which I think it is a much better approach to documenting system or software requirements.
Please refer to those documents.
